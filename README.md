# SCEMS-Narative-App
This app is a functional EMS non-emergency narrative generator. It's main screen contains two forms: one form that generates narratives for dialysis trips, and another form that generates naratives for doctor's appointment transports. Both forms pull data from patients that you enter into the app's storage. The app utilizes JSON files to store patient data and grab patient data to use when generating narratives. The app also has a "Patient Management Window" which can be used to enter patient information into storage to be pulled from when generating naratives. The Patient Management Window can also be used to edit patient data that has been stored.
